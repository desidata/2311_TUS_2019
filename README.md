# A Random Day in India

Time Use Survey (2019) was conducted by the National Statistical Office (NSO) under the
supervision of the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI). The duration
of the survey was January 2019 to December 2019. The unit of data collection for this survey
were households. It covered 1,38,799 households using a two-stage stratified random sampling
method for the selection of households.

In TUS 2019 information regarding Time Spent on different activities is collected for members
who are aged 6 years and above. The information pertains to a period of 24 hours starting from
4:00 A.M. on the day before the date of interview to 4:00 A.M. on the day of interview. Different
activities are then clubbed into classification that is provided by the International Classification
of Activities for Time Use Survey (ICATUS) 2016. This classification of activity (a 3 digit code)

can be grouped into 9 major activity codes:

$\bullet$ Employment and Related Activities.

$\bullet$ Production of Goods for Own (final) Use

$\bullet$ Unpaid Domestic Services for Household Members

$\bullet$ Unpaid Care-giving Services for Household Members

$\bullet$ Unpaid Volunteer, trainee, and other unpaid works.

$\bullet$ Learning

$\bullet$ Socialising, Communication, and Community Participation.

$\bullet$ Culture, Leisure, Mass Media Consumption.

$\bullet$ Self-Care and Maintenance.

In this project, we have first selected a random sample of 1000 persons using a uniform (0,1)
random number generator from the NSO sample. We did not select transgender/other gender in
this study purposively, since the overall sample had very few observations.
We have then grouped activity 3,4,and 5 into a single activity classification code (since these are
all unpaid workers) for this 1000 randomly selected persons.
NSO sample uses multipliers and weights to arrive at population estimates, but here we are only
interested in how would a randomly selected 1000 persons day look like when broken down into
activity codes, therefore the data represented here is unweighted. It is a sample case study of
India, not a representation of population estimates.
